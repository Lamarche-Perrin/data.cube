Description: Exploring multidimensional datasets and detecting statistical outliers within. This package defines a new data structure that can be fed with a classical data.frame. It encodes a list of numeric variables described according to several categorical dimensions. This package is mainly a tool for data exploration, allowing to have a first glance at it and to formulate research hypotheses to be later tested.
